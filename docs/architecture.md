# Architecture

> **Last reviewed:** 2026-10-10 · **Last updated:** 2026-10-10 · **Change:** major (created from the code; the full design notes stay in the local `plan/architecture.md`) · **Target:** Adobe Lightroom Classic 15.5 / Lightroom 9.6

How LightCraft is built today. The longer design document (`plan/architecture.md`) is local-only
(`plan/` is gitignored); this page is the committed, current summary. Sizes are Rust lines counted
on 2026-10-10 (≈ 202,000 tracked lines in 505 files: 24 library crates, 3 apps and `xtask`).

## Layers

`cargo xtask layers` (part of `cargo xtask ci`, `xtask/src/layers.rs`) enforces that nothing below
L5 depends on egui, eframe, winit or rfd, and that each crate only uses lower layers.

| Layer | Crates (lines) | Role |
|---|---|---|
| L0 | `geom` (1.4k), `color` (0.9k), `raster` (0.8k), `tiff` (2.0k), `fetch` (1.4k), `sysmem` (0.1k) | Matrices and warps, colour spaces and transfer functions, float image buffers, TIFF/IFD read and write, pinned HTTPS model downloads, the one `unsafe` FFI call (`malloc_zone_pressure_relief`) |
| L1 | `raw` (22.3k), `codecs` (7.3k), `meta` (4.3k), `develop` (2.5k), `denoise-core` (2.2k), `denoise` (2.7k), `faces` (5.3k), `scenes` (1.0k), `heif` (2.1k, optional) | Raw decoders and demosaic, DNG colour model; standard codecs and encoders; EXIF/XMP/IPTC; the non-destructive edit model and control specs; AI denoise; face detection and recognition; procedural demo photos; HEIC |
| L2 | `pipeline` (9.8k) | The develop pipeline: scene-referred float, resolution independent; the CPU reference (oracle) for everything else |
| L3 | `catalog` (11.0k), `gpu` (5.1k), `preview` (1.3k), `merge` (3.8k), `segment` (2.3k) | Library model and persistence; wgpu compute twin of the pipeline; thumbnail/preview cache and job pool; HDR and panorama merge; SAM 3 segmentation |
| L4 | `engine` (53.2k) | Session, command registry (everything is a command), history, render and export jobs, import, Lightroom catalog and preset import, faces index, view-models |
| L5 | `ui-egui` (46.9k), `mcp` (2.3k) | The Lightroom-style egui interface (swappable); the MCP server |
| L6 | `apps/lightcraft` (2.8k), `apps/lightcraft-cli` (1.5k), `apps/lightcraft-web` (3.4k), `xtask` (2.7k) | Desktop app (eframe + wgpu, native menus, control server), CLI (render, commands, calibrate, snapshot, MCP), WASM build, tooling |

## Data model

- **Photo** records in `catalog` hold the original's path, content hash, metadata, ratings, flags,
  labels, keywords, faces and the current `develop::Settings`. Albums, smart albums (rule trees),
  stacks, virtual copies, versions and folder records live alongside.
- **Persistence** (`crates/catalog/src/journal.rs`): an append-only journal of human-readable
  operations plus periodic snapshots, compacted in the background; torn appends and crashes are
  tested (`tests_torn_append.rs`, `tests_journal.rs`). A lock file guards against two writers.
- **Edits** are a `develop::Settings` value (every slider is a control spec with id, range and
  default), normalized to image coordinates so previews and exports match. Process versions
  (`docs/process-versions.md`) keep old edits rendering the same after a retune.
- **Sidecars**: XMP read and write with Adobe `crs:` interop (`docs/xmp-interop.md`); Lightroom
  Classic `.lrcat` import through a pure-Rust SQLite reader (`docs/lightroom-catalog-import.md`).

## Rendering

1. **Decode** (`raw`, `codecs`): raw files to linear camera RGB (demosaic, black/white levels,
   opcodes, highlight handling) and a camera-to-XYZ colour model; standard images to linear light
   through their ICC profile.
2. **Develop** (`pipeline`): white balance, profile, exposure and tone (local Laplacian
   highlights/shadows), curves, HSL / colour mixer, point colour, colour grading, texture, clarity,
   dehaze, detail (sharpening, NR, AI denoise result), optics (lens profile, CA, defringe,
   vignette), geometry (crop, Upright, transforms), masks with local adjustments, heal/clone, grain,
   effects. Stage caching and a source pyramid make slider drags cheap.
3. **GPU** (`gpu`): the same stages in WGSL on Metal / DX12 / Vulkan, checked against the CPU path
   (within 1/255); GPU errors fall back to the CPU (`docs/gpu-pipeline.md`).
4. **Display and export**: display-profile conversion (`docs/display-profiles.md`); export through
   one encoder for app, CLI, MCP and web (`lightcraft_engine::export`).

## Agent control

Every action is an engine command (id, label, menu path, shortcut, params, enabled, run). The UI,
the CLI, the JSON-lines control channel (`docs/control-protocol.md`) and MCP (`docs/mcp.md`) all
dispatch by id, and headless snapshots render the UI without a window.

## Quality gates

`cargo xtask ci`: fmt, clippy `-D warnings` with the never-crash lints, the HEIF build, tests,
`parity` (every id and path cited in [parity-checklist.md](parity-checklist.md) exists), `layers`,
`assets` (every asset attributed, no Adobe formats) and the WASM build. Other workflows build and
test FreeBSD and Windows ARM64, lint packaging, and build releases.
