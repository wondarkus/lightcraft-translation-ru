# Process versions

Every photo's develop settings record the **rendering process** they are interpreted by
(`DevelopSettings::process`, a `ProcessVersion` in `crates/develop/src/settings.rs`). Lightroom calls
this the process version. It lets the look of LightCraft improve (a new default tone curve, issue #146;
stronger Light sliders, issue #196) without changing a single photo someone has already edited.

Today there is one process, **V1**: LightCraft's rendering from before process versions existed.

## The rule

**A change that alters how existing settings render ships as a new process. V1 is frozen.**

- A deliberate change of look (tone model, slider response, default curve, how a stage interprets a
  value) goes into a new process. Photos stay on the process they have until someone runs Update to
  Current Process (or Reset).
- Bug fixes that make output correct where it was broken (a crash, NaN or black output, a decoder
  error, CPU and GPU disagreeing) are not looks and can land in place, as before.
- Changes to how a file is decoded or which camera colour it gets change the source, not how settings
  are interpreted; the process doesn't reach that stage today.

## Adding a process

1. Add a variant to `Process` (`V2`), append it to `Process::ALL` (oldest first), give it its number in
   `Process::version` and make it `Process::LATEST`.
2. The compiler then points at every `match` on `Process`. The base tone map is chosen in one place,
   `lightcraft_pipeline::finish::base_tone` (both the CPU and the GPU renderer take it from there): give
   V2 its own arm and leave V1's alone. A process that changes another stage branches there the same
   way, on `s.process.process()`; if that stage is cached (`Plan::lin_key`, the planes in `local.rs`),
   add the process to its key.
3. Keep `settings_saved_before_process_versions_load_as_v1` (`crates/develop/src/tests_process.rs`)
   passing: settings saved without the field must stay V1, not become the new latest. That is the
   field's `#[serde(default = "ProcessVersion::legacy")]`; the struct-level `Default` gives new
   settings the latest instead.
4. Render a few procedural scenes on both processes and compare, and update `docs/parity-checklist.md`.

## What gets which process

| | Process |
|---|---|
| A newly imported, merged or Lightroom-imported photo | the latest |
| Settings saved without the field (catalogs and their snapshots, versions and history, `lc:settings` in XMP sidecars, browser libraries: everything from before process versions), or with a damaged value | V1 |
| Reset (`develop.reset`) | the latest |
| Reset of a section or a slider | unchanged |
| Update to Current Process (`develop.updateProcess`) | the latest, for photos on an older one; one undo step. The menu item follows the selection; a call with `ids` / `id` acts on those photos whatever is selected |
| Virtual copy, duplicate | the source's |
| Copy / paste / sync / Auto Sync / presets | unchanged (see below) |
| `crs:` edits (XMP from other raw developers, Lightroom catalogs, imported presets) | unchanged; a new photo has the latest |
| Restoring a version or history step | the one it had |

**Copy, paste, sync and presets** never carry the process: it is in no settings group, so the photos
they change keep their own and interpret the pasted values with it. (Lightroom offers the process
version as a separate checkbox when syncing; LightCraft's groups are coarser and keep it out.) Partial
settings JSON that names `process` itself (`develop.merge`, a hand-written preset) sets it.

**Lightroom edits** are re-interpreted by LightCraft's mapper (`crates/engine/src/crs.rs`), which is
written against the current rendering. `crs:ProcessVersion` numbers Adobe's renderer, not ours, and is
ignored; a photo imported with Lightroom edits is on LightCraft's latest process, and an existing
LightCraft photo that receives them keeps its own.

**A number this build doesn't know** (a library or sidecar written by a newer LightCraft) loads, is
kept when saved, and renders with the newest process this build has. Update to Current Process never
moves a photo to an older process; Reset does move it to this build's latest.

**A damaged value** (anything but a whole number from 0 to 2^32 - 1; `2.0` counts as 2) reads as V1,
like a missing field, and costs nothing else: the rest of the settings load from the catalog, a
snapshot, the op log or an `lc:settings` sidecar as usual. The damaged value isn't kept: the photo is
saved as V1.

## Storage

The process is saved as `"process": <number>` in the settings JSON, except V1, which is left out.
Settings made before process versions existed are therefore saved exactly as before, and their
preview-cache keys (`DevelopSettings::hash64`) don't change. `develop.get` (MCP `get_develop`) always
states the process.
